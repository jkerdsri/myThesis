Recently, wireless networking are witnessing several deployments in various extreme environments where they usually suffer from different levels of link disruptions depending on the severity of the operations. 
Commonly, these networks are known as Intermittently Connected Networks (ICNs). 
An ICNs, also known as a Challenged Network, is an infrastructure-less wireless network that supports the proper functionality of the wireless applications operating in stressful environments, where excessive delays and no existence of end-to-end path(s) between any arbitrary source-destination pair, result from highly repetitive link disruptions \cite{Khabbaz2012}.
In order to handle ICNs, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) \cite{Cerf2007} proposed an architecture called Delay-/Disruption-Tolerant Networks (DTNs).
DTNs can basically be categorized into 3 types: scheduled networks, predictable networks and opportunistic networks.
In this thesis, we focus on the research on the most extreme case of DTNs which is the opportunistic networks.

This chapter gives the background knowledge of this thesis. 
The background of Delay Tolerant Networks is presented in Section~\ref{bg:Delay Tolerant Networks}. 
Additionally, an explanation of Opportunistic Networks is presented in Section~\ref{bg:Opportunistic Networks}. 
%=============================================================================
\section{Delay Tolerant Networks}
\label{bg:Delay Tolerant Networks}
%=============================================================================
DTNs is an overlay architecture with an aim to operate over the protocol stacks of the ICNs and enable gateway functionality between them through the use of storage capacity, a variety of protocol techniques, replication and parallel forwarding, forward error correction and many other techniques for overcoming the impairments of communication  \cite{Khabbaz2012}.
DTNs enable the transferring of data in extremely challenging environments where networks are assumed to experience frequent, long-duration partitioning and may have no end-to-end connectivity between source and destination \cite{Liu2011}. 
Therefore, the timer and acknowledgement mechanisms of the traditional TCP/IP protocol definitely fail in such circumstances \cite{Souza2010}.
In addition, the routing algorithms designed for Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) can not perform effectively under aforementioned constraints as well, since the availability of contemporaneous end-to-end connectivity is essential for conventional routing algorithms \cite{Yue2013}.

Basically the types of DTNs can be classified in 3 categories: scheduled networks, predictable networks and opportunistic networks as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:bg:Type of DTN}.
In DTNs, predictable and scheduled networks are the common aim in designing the routing protocols in the highly disruptive environments such as Interplanetary Internet (IPN) \cite{Burleigh2003} where the contact time is not completely random but in periodic interval.
In the thesis, we study in the most extreme case of DTNs which is the opportunistic networks where the contact time is undetermined along with stochastic movements.

\section{Opportunistic Networks}
\label{bg:Opportunistic Networks}
%=============================================================================
In fact, Opportunistic networks focus on mobile ad-hoc DTNs, where tolerant delayed routes between the source and destination are built dynamically.
However, OppNets is different from MANETs that it does not assume the existing end-to-end connectivity.
Therefore, instead of depending on end-to-end MANETs routing protocols, the messages are delivered through one hop data transmission among opportunistic node encounters with intermediate node storage and mobility, called \textit{Store-Carry-Forward paradigm} \cite{Hu2009,Yamamura2011}. 
In essential, there are three common steps of routing in OppNet \cite{Hsu2011}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Broadcast the messages to candicate relayed nodes.
	\item Select the best candidate node.
	\item Forward the messages.
\end{itemize}



%=============================================================================
\subsection{Opportunistic Routing}
\label{bg:Opportunistic Networks:Opportunistic Routing}
%=============================================================================
In this opportunistic routing, the nodes can exchange data in a spontaneous manner whenever they come in close.
If there is no direct connection from source to destination, data holding nodes will discover their nearest neighbor nodes to forward messages toward the destination node.
Thus, this opportunistic route is determined at each hop when messages traverse through different hops.
In this routing scheme, mobile nodes are normally equipped with local knowledge of the best nodes around them to determine the best path to transmit the messages with this knowledge.
In the case of such nodes absence, the node currently holding the message simply stores the messages and wait for an opportunity to forward the packets.
This  infrastructure-less wireless network environment requires common 2 factors to facilitate the opportunistic routing \cite{Poonguzharselvi2013a} : 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Destination path finding:
	Intermediate nodes are used to form paths dynamically since there is no fixed path from source to destination nodes.
	\item Next hop forwarder selection:
	Data holding nodes need to find a helper node that can forward the messages to the destination as soon as possible.
\end{itemize}


%=============================================================================
\subsection{Classification of Opportunistic Routing}
\label{bg:Opportunistic Networks:Classification of Opportunistic Routing}
%=============================================================================

Several researches proposed opportunistic routing algorithms based on store-carry-forward mechanism.
The existing common OR algorithms can be classified based on their data forwarding behavior as shown in Figure \ref{fig:bg:RoutingInOppNets}

\subsubsection{Direct Transmission}
\label{bg:Opportunistic Networks:Classification of Opportunistic Routing:DT}
The source node in direct transmission routing generates the messages and stores it until it directly meet the destination node.
Spyropoulos et al \cite{Spyropoulos2004} proposed a single-copy routing in intermittently connected mobile networks using hop-by-hop routing model.
In this single-copy routing, only one copy per message can be transmitted from source node to destination node.
This routing algorithm significantly reduces the resource requirements of flooding-based algorithms \cite{Spyropoulos2008}.
However, this scheme produces significantly long delays since the delivery delay is unbounded for this direct transmission routing \cite{Grossglauser2002}.

\subsubsection{Flooding Based}
\label{bg:Opportunistic Networks:Classification of Opportunistic Routing:FB}
The flooding based routing (multiple copies) approach may generate several copies of the same message to be routed independently to increase the efficiency and robustness \cite{Chung-Ming2008}.  
This flooding based routing can be divided into 2 types:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Uncontrolled:
	In this approach, each node broadcasts the received packet to all of the neighbors without restricted to any limited. 
	Epidemic routing \cite{Vahdat2000} is proposed utilizing epidemic algorithm to send each message to all nodes in the network.
	Even tough the Epidemic routing can guarantees all nodes will eventually receive all messages, it incurs significant demand on both bandwidth and buffer.
	\item Controlled:
	Undoubtedly, uncontrolled flooding consume network resources which can seriously degrade the performance if the resources are scarce \cite{Tonguz2006}.
	Therefore, there is a need to control the flooding by limit the number of packets to be replicated to reduce the network contention.
	Several researches proposed the algorithms to control the flooding such as controlled flooding, spray and wait and spray and focus.
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item Controlled Flooding: 
		Khaled et al \cite{Khaled2009} proposed a set of Controlled Flooding schemes to address the excessive network resources from flooding. 
		Four schemes have been examined in this study: Basic probabilistic (BP), Time-to-live (TTL), Kill time and Passive one.
		The extensive experiments show that proposed schemes can save substantial network resources while incurring a negligible increase in the message delivery delay.
		As a result, the ability to provide reliable data delivery while resolving excess traffic overhead, controlled flooding protocol can greatly reduce the network overhead.
		
		\item Spray and Wait:
		Spyropoulos et al \cite{Spyropoulos2005} introduced a Spray and Wait routing scheme consisting of two phases: first, \emph{sprays} a number of copies into the network, and then \emph{waits} till one of these nodes meets the destination to bound the overhead of delivering message.
		In the \emph{spray} phase, a number of \emph{L} messages are created in which \emph{L} indicates the maximum allowable copies of the messages in the network to \emph{L} distinct relays.
		In the \emph{wait} phase, when the destination nodes are not encountered by a node with a copy of the message in the spraying phase, each node with a copy of message will perform the direct transmission.
		
		\item Spray and Focus: Another controlled flooding approach by Spyropoulos et al \cite{Spyropoulos2007} was designed to eliminate some deficiencies of Spray and Wait routing algorithm in some network schemes.
		Similar to Spray and Wait protocol, this algorithm consists of two phases: Spray phase and Focus phase.
		The \emph{spray} phase is operated the same way as in Spray and Wait which \emph{L} message copies are spread to all \emph{L} different nodes for every message creating at source node.
		The different from the \emph{wait} phase is that in the \emph{focus} phase, each copy in a single node is attempted to be routed to a closed node using a single-copy utility based scheme \cite{Spyropoulos2008}.
	 
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Prediction Based}
The prediction based routing algorithms are proposed to overcome the overhead carried by flooding based routing schemes. In Prediction based routing, nodes estimate the probability of forwarding messages to the destination based on the history of observations instead of blindly forward the messages to all/some neighbors. 
With the information, nodes can decide whether they should store or wait for the better chance to forward the messages as well as deciding which nodes to forward the messages to.

\label{bg:Opportunistic Networks:Classification of Opportunistic Routing:PB}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item PROPHET:
		Lindgren et al \cite{Lindgren2004} proposed PROPHET (Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity) as a probabilistic routing protocol.
		This protocol estimates a probabilistic metric called delivery predictability to indicate the probability of successful delivery of a message from local node to the destination.
		Two nodes can exchange both a summary vector containing delivery probability vector when they meet.
		The delivery probability metric is derived from previous encounters and subject to an aging factor, meaning if two nodes are often encountered, they have high delivery predictability to each other.
		On the other hand, if a pair of nodes rarely encounter, they are intuitively not a good candidate to forward messages to each other.
		The results from the simulations show that PROPHET is able to deliver more messages than Epidemic Routing with a lower communication overhead.
		
		\item MobySpace:
		Leguay et al \cite{Leguay2005,Leguay2006} proposed a MobySpace: Mobility Pattern Space Routing for DTNs which using a high-dimensional Euclidean space constructed upon nodes' mobility patterns.
		%%
		In this MobySpace protocol, the routing decisions are taken using nodes’  virtual Euclidean space with the notion that a node is a good candidate for taking custody of a bundle if it has a mobility pattern similar to that of the bundle’s destination.
		%%
		The results from the simulations show that MobySpace outperforms the other single copy schemes in delivery ratio while keeping a low number of transmissions.

		\item MV:
		Burns et al \cite{Burns2005} proposed the MV algorithm, which is based on observed meetings between nodes and visits of nodes to geographic location.
		%%
		This protocol learns the meeting frequency of meetings between the nodes and which cells in the grid are frequently visited by each node in order to rank the likelihood of delivering a bundle through a path of meetings.
		%%
		The experiment shows that this algorithm can achieving delivery rates closer to the true optimal rate.
	\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Context Based}
\label{bg:Opportunistic Networks:Classification of Opportunistic Routing:CXB}

Nevertheless, the predication based routing failed in several scenarios with the reduction in delivery rates comparing to the flooding based approach.
%%
The context based approach is proposed as a revision of prediction based protocols in order to gain higher delivery ratio.
%%
The concept of context is commonly defined as a collection of information by taking the \emph{social aspect} of nodes in to the account as an important parameter to route the messages \cite{Nguyen2009}, which motivated by the fact that the mobility decision is relied on the carriers such as human, animals or vehicles.
%%
In fact, both MobySpace and MV can be also viewed as one type of context based routings exploiting the mobility pattern and places that nodes are frequently visit, but the prediction capability of those protocols are considered as a major factor to categorize them in the prediction based routing.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item HiBOp:
		A History Based Routing Protocol for Opportunistic Networks or HiBOp were proposed by Boldrini et al \cite{Boldrini2007} as a general framework for managing and using context for forwarding decisions.
		%%
		In HiBOp, nodes can share their own information locally storing in the \emph{Identity Table (IT)} during contacts.
		%%
		The \textit{IT} consists of personal information of users carrying the devices while the nodes keeping the record of current neighbors' \textit{ITs} which can be called \emph{Current Context}.
		%%
		In addition, mobile nodes are also maintaining the information of encountered history about their habits and past experiences.
		%%
		The key idea behind HiBOp forwarding is to select the candidate nodes that showing the increasing match with known context attributes of the destination.
		%%
		The comparison with Epidemic and PROPHET shows that HiBOp can reduce resource consumption and message loss rate while preserving the performance in terms of message delay.

		\item PROPICMAN:
		Nguyen et al \cite{Nguyen2007} proposed the Probabilistic Routing Protocol for Intermittently Connected Mobile Ad hoc Network (PROPICMAN) in which the context information is represented by the \emph{node profile}with evidence/value pairs upon contact opportunities to forward the messages. 
		%%
		The main idea behind PROPICMAN is to look for the increasing matching user profiles between destination and encountered nodes, similarly to HiBoP.
		%%
		However, a distinctive function between PROPICMAN and HiBOp is the exploiting decision trees to select the next hop \cite{Conti2010}.
		%%
		This method exploits the mobility as well as reduces the number of nodes involving in the forwarding process, which results in the low overhead comparing to the other dissemination-oriented routing algorithms, such as Epidemic or PROPHET \cite{isaac2013}. 

		\item Community Based:
		The types of opportunistic networks that consist of mobile nodes with social characteristics are called community based opportunistic network (CON) or Mobile social networks (MSNs).
		%%
		Niu et al \cite{Jianwei2009} proposed Community-based Data Transmission Scheme (CDTS) by utilizing the characteristics of social networks.
		%%
		The idea behind CDTS is based on the observation that social nodes always have different social roles which can determine the activity area and mobility pattern.
		%%
		Moreover, the social nodes tend to have higher probability to move within their community while containing lower chance to leave the local community to other community. 
		%%
		The mobility model of this scheme has been designed to match the real mobility characteristics of CDTS.
		%%
		The simulation results show that by adjusting the number of data copies and forwarding condition, CDTS can achieve efficient data transmission with less resource consumption.
		%%
		In addition, Xiao et al \cite{Mingjun2014} proposed a distributed optimal Community-Aware Opportunistic Routing (CAOR) algorithm by modeling an MSN into overlapping home-aware community.
		%%
		The first step is to turn the routing among a number of nodes into the routing between community homes.
		%%
		Then, an optimal relay set of each home is maintained and each home can only forward the messages to the nodes in its relay set and ignores the others.
		%%
		Comparing with previous social-aware routing such as Bubbl rap \cite{pan2011}, this algorithm can achieve the optimal routing performance with a very low maintenance cost.
	\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Coding Based}
\label{bg:Opportunistic Networks:Classification of Opportunistic Routing:CB}
%%
The coding based routing is proposed to address the transmission issues in very poor network connectivity.
%%
By transforming a message into another format prior to the transmission with embedded additional information, the coding based schemes are more robust than replication based routing because the original message can be reconstructed with only a certain number of the code blocks.
%%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Erasure Coding (EC):
		The main idea of Erasure coding \cite{Wang2005} is converting a message into a larger set of code blocks in which the original message can be reconstructed by large subset of the generated code blocks.
		%%
		To delineate the detailed process, an algorithm produces $ M \cdot \sfrac{r}{b}$ equal sized code blocks of size $b$ of	a message of size $M$ a replication factor $r$.
		%%
		Consequently, the messages can be reconstructed by  $(1+\epsilon) \cdot \sfrac{M}{b}$ erasure coded blocks where $\epsilon$ is a small constant 
		varying by the utilizing algorithm, such as Reed-Solomon codes or Tornado codes \cite{Chung2003}.
		%%
		Due to the additional information embedded in the code blocks, coding based schemes are less efficient when the network is well connected \cite{Yu2006}.

		\item Hybrid (H-EC):
		Chen et al \cite{Chen2006} proposed A Hybrid Routing Approach for Opportunistic Networks (H-EC) to fully combine the advantage of EC robustness while maintaining the efficient of flooding based routing technique. 
		%%
		In H-EC algorithm, the sender will transmit two copies of EC blocks. 
		%%
		The first copy is transmitted in the same manner of original EC scheme.
		%%
		After sending the first EC block, the second EC block is transmitted using A-EC algorithm during the residual contact duration. 
		%%
		With A-EC algorithm, the source sends as many coded blocks as possible during each contact in order to gain better utilization of the network contact.
		%%
		As a result, H-EC can gain better forwarding performance in the worst delay performance.
		%%
		The simulation results suggest that H-EC achieve good performance in small delay performance cases while offering robustness in worst-case delay performance cases.
	\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Content Based}
\label{bg:Opportunistic Networks:Classification of Opportunistic Routing:CTB}
%%
Because of the Store-Carry-Forward paradigm requires a node to store and carry the messages in order to find the opportunity to forward the messages, the content storage can become the core service of opportunistic routing.
%%
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Content Classification:
		%%
		JIAO et al \cite{Jiao2009} proposed the data dissemination method that classified the forwarding messages based on their content to reduce the transmitted messages in the network.
		%%
		The idea behind this method is that every node only requests the message that it is interested in, so that the delivery rate can be improved.
		%%
		This method can largely cut down the number of messages transmitted in the the network since it avoids sending all messages when nodes get contacted.
		%%
		In addition, a buffer management scheme based on the content popularity is proposed, by managing the buffer based on the time that messages are requested.
		%%
		The simulation results show that the content classification can maintain high delivery ratio while attaining low over head and low delay.

		\item Content Framework: 
		%%
		A content-centric framework was proposed by Chen et al \cite{Chen2008} to better facilitate content dissemination based on the characteristics of the content of the messages.
		%%
		Three message scheduling algorithms were proposed: Sequential Forwarding (SF), Full Interleaving (FI), and Block-based Interleaving (BI).
		%%
		The evaluation were performed on three types of content, including file, video and web documents with the Layered Multiple Description Coding (LMDC) based dissemination methods and file-based.
		%%
		The simulation results as well as synthetic and realistic network scenarios show that the proposed schemes can achieve much better latency performance for file transfer.

		
	\end{itemize}

In this chapter, we tried to summarize and categorized the characteristics of routing algorithms in opportunistic networks.
%%
For more extensive researches on OppNet on the related work in the literature can also look at some surveys such as \cite{Yue2013, Souza2010, Poonguzharselvi2013a, Nousiainen2013, Behrouz2013, Wahid2014}.
%%
In conclusion, several opportunistic routing approaches have been proposed to address the issues of MANET which only exploits the insufficient topological information.
%%
The early approaches proposed the flooding techniques from \emph{blindly} flooding method to controlled flooding solutions in order to reduce the network overhead from flooding based routings.
%%
Later on, more advanced approaches have been proposed with the higher-level of information rather than only the topological information such as forwarding the messages to the nodes with higher chance of meeting the destination in PROPHET.
%%
Then several aspects of OppNet routing approaches have been proposed to address different issues of opportunistic routing.
%%
In content and context based routing, the forwarding decisions are based on the additional information acquired by the mobile nodes such as the node's social behaviors in context based routing and the information inside the data packet in the case of content based routing. 
%%
The coding based schemes tend to be more robust than the replication based schemes in the worst delay performance cases while they are less efficient on the very small delay performance cases
%%
All in all, most of the previously proposed routings work well in the moderate to dense node density environments because they require the collaboration among mobile nodes.
%%
To the best of our knowledge, the attempt to address the delivery performance of OppNet in extremely sparse networks has not been proposed.
%%
In order to address aforementioned issue, the DRRA algorithm in context based routing and DORSI algorithm in content based routing are proposed in chapter 3 and 4.
